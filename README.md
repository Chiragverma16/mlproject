##  Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict a student’s math score using the following features:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Level of Education  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Course  
- Reading Score  
- Writing Score  

This system helps analyze how various social and academic factors influence student performance.
